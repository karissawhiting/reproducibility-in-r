## What is Reproducibility?

::: incremental

A data analysis is [reproducible]{.emphasized} if all the information (data, files, etc.) needed to compute results is available for someone else to re-do your entire analysis and get the same results. 

- All data processing steps from `raw data` to `cleaned data` are available and documented

- All analysis decisions made are documented and available in code

- Results don't depend on your specific computational environment (e.g. no hard coded file paths, seeds set for stochastic computations)

:::

## Why is Reproducibility Important?

::: incremental

- Allows you to show evidence of your results

- Encourages transparency about decisions made during analysis

- Enables others to check and use/extend your methods and results

- Enables FUTURE YOU to check and use/extend your methods and results




***"You mostly collaborate with yourself, and me-from-two-months-ago never responds to email"***

## Why is Reproducibility Important?


Dangers of writing code that is hard to double-check or confirm:

## Updated NIH Guidelines

[NIH Data Management & Sharing Policy Updates]{.emphasized}

- Effective Date: January 25, 2023
- Purpose: Enhance data sharing to advance research transparency & reproducibility

<br> 

[Key Requirements:]{.emphasized}

  - As of 1/2023, all NIH Grants must create and adhere to a Data Management Plan (DMP)
  - This plan will likely requires sharing of research data, and in some cases, code. 
  - You may be asked to provide your cleaned analysis data (and possibly code) at time of publication or end of grant.

## Five Pillars Of Reproducibility

## How Do We Ensure Our Code is Reproducible?


- [Compute Environment Control]{.emphasized}
  - Virtual environments, avoid absolute file paths (e.g. `~/Users/Whiting/Projects...`) 

- [Code Version Control]{.emphasized}
  - Document changes you make, or use git/Github

- [Documentation]{.emphasized}
  - Comment and document your code
  - Invest in a good `README.md`

- [Data Integrity]{.emphasized} - more details later

- [Literate Programming]{.emphasized}
  - Have a clear project structure, avoid 'by hand' steps


## Literate Programming

[Avoid 'by hand' steps used in the analysis]{.emphasized}

- Don't clean by hand in Excel. All analysis steps should be done in code and saved in well-documented scripts. 
    
- If any 'non-scriptable' steps are unavoidable, document those steps very clearly

- DNR (Do Not Repeat) - if you do it more than 3 times, consider writing a function

- Use [reproducible reporting]{.emphasized} practices for analyses (e.g. Rmd, quarto, Jupyter notebook, inline text stats)


# Reproducible Reporting {background-color="#007CBA" style="text-align: center;"}

## Reproducible Reporting


- [R Markdown]{.emphasized}, [Quarto]{.emphasized} and [Jupyter]{.emphasized} are tools for integrating code and narrative text into a single executable document

- Can be rendered into various **output formats** (HTML, PDF, Word, and slides)

- Detailed code and data analysis steps are included in one document, encouraging **transparency** and providing a complete record of the research process 

- Documents automatically update when data or code changes, **reducing errors** and **maintaining consistency**.

- Version-control compatible 


## Quarto Features: Callouts and Comments

Sometimes you need to draw attention to something in your report. You can do this using `{.callout-note}`

```
::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::
```
