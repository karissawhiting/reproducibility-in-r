## {lubridate}

-   We work with [a LOT of dates]{.emphasized}
-   [{lubridate}]{.emphasized} helps parse dates from strings, and improves functional operations on date-times
-   Data cleaning training will cover this in more depth or see R for Data Science: <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html>

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(lubridate)

bday <- dmy("14/10/1940")
month(bday)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true

wday(bday, label = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true

year(bday) <- 2016
wday(bday, label = TRUE)
```

# Data Versioning

- How data versions are managed is still highly depending on what service and data types you work with

- For genomic or imaging data, try to use a standardized pipeline 

- For clinical data, try to establish a workflow with your service collaborators.

- **Avoid making changes to excel yourself**

- Use the `README` to track
